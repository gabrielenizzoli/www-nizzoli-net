After 7 years at Taboola (and 6 years at Perfectmarket before that), the time has come to change things a bit and move to a new company.
*"I open at the close"* is what is written on a small ball that hides a life-restoring magic stone, and Harry Potter discovers this stone just being killed by *YouKnowWho*.
Thanks to the magic stone Harry lives, and the story continues.

No one killed me, thankfully, but nevertheless I feel like part of my (professional) life has come to a *close* and another one is starting. 
Let's see what this new life has to bring.
