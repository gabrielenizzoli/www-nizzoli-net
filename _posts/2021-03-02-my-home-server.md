In Sept 2020 I decided that I needed a home server to do some development.
For the purpose I wanted a PC able to execute a decently-sized Apache Spark job, and run some middle-tier tensor flow model.

The server is currently dual-booting Ubuntu and Win10.

List of component:

* AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-core, 24-thread ![right-aligned-image](/images/amd_ryzen.jpg){: .align-right}
* Sabrent 1TB Rocket NVMe 4.0 Gen4 PCIe M.2 Internal SSD
* EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 KO GAMING Video Card
* G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 64GB (2 x 32GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600)
* ASRock X570M PRO4 AM4 AMD X570 SATA 6Gb/s Micro ATX AMD
